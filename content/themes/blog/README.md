#Feliganesh Project

This project includes a portifolio and a blog.

To include a page in the portifolio, just check the option `Turn this post into a static page` in the bottom of the settings section of each page. To access this section, just click in engine icon when writting the article.


# Note for developers

The framework used (ghost) recognizes the content of `page.hbs` as portifolio content, and `post.hbs` as an article of the blog.
